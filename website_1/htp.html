		There are three main safe areas, but the lava is coming in hot! We will have to defend ourselves. Whilst trying to survive, you will need to find objects to save you from the lava. Look around you with your phone to find the several objects that are hidden around you. Every now and then, an item that will help you finish the game successfully will pop up. Try to collect those as fast as possible. To start a game, you will need at least two other participants to play against. 
By collecting all the items that repair the leak, you will be able to create a super soaker that cools down the lava that is endangering you, which will make you the ultimate winner of the game. Another way to win is by being the sole survivor of the scorching lava.
